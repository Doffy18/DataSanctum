where we save our work? git or Kaggle.

Start from this, just to get an outline:

forget cricket analysis due to lack of dataset, instead do this:

honestly, now we are ready for boss fights... lets head to Kaggle(I hope u choose right path and didn't not fall for git) and start working on open source projects.before that if u need u can create ur own projects by downloading random datasets and play with it like how a 3yr old ruthlessly murders a poor bug... mb...anyway get going. if u still stuvk with git...contact me.. I shall provide u some more stuff.

I will be bring part 2 of getting started,where we will dive deeper into Kaggle and also get our hands on some paying open sources(dreams...)
