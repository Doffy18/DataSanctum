part 1.1 continue:(we did all regression type projects in earlier phase, and i thought it would be incomplete to go further in to Kaggle without doing a classification and unsupervised clustering project. so here are easiest one available.)

1.sms classification:

since we done like 5 projects till now
1.dragon real estate(basics)
2.movie recommendation(ik we jst set a standard from this)
3.cricket analysis(something trending and new)
4.sms classification(classifier, setting standard)
5.customer segmentaton(clustering, again setting standard)

see, didnt we explore all fields quickly?
